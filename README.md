# Unaga Line Follower Robot

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Unaga Line Follower Robot. The robot is a simple autonomous robot that can follow a black line on a white surface. It uses infrared sensors to detect the line and make necessary adjustments to keep the robot on track.

## Getting Started

To build and program your own Unaga Line Follower Robot, you will need the following components:

## Usage

To use the Unaga Line Follower Robot, simply turn it on and place it on a white surface with a black line. The robot will use its infrared sensors to detect the line and follow it. You can adjust the speed and turning behavior of the robot by modifying the code parameters.
